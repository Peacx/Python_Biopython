# File handling with Python
Date: 23rd October, 2025

This project demonstrates the usefulness of file handling in python, focusing on biological data that is usually contained in file types like .fasta. It includes:
- Use of Biopython
- Opening of fasta files in python
- Biological analysis done using fasta files like GC content, nucleotide count, motif position etc.
- Saving selected results gotten from the analysis done on python to a seperate file, it was a txt file in this case.
